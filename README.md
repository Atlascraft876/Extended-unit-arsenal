# Extended-unit-arsenal

(Status: Updating)

9 new "cruiser-class" units (revenant variant)
2 new "capitals" (along with lich and reaper factories)
and 2 powerful "mothership" class destroyers are added into 
mindustry. All require the vanilla resources and have sprites which 
resemble the vanilla art style 

3 new land units.
6 new turrets
1 Super boss unit

5 new campaign maps.

-New Areas beyond Disconsolate passage-

3 new campaign map
2 new ores
5 new turrets
7 new enemies

Hopefully this mod doesn't die in v6 lmao. RIP molten chasm fprtress facs

(if you want to play around with the units in sandbox
I recommend increasing unit production
speed in custom settings or downloading infinitodustry and using the 
overjector because capital ship production time
is SLOW)
