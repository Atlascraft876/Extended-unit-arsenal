# Extended-unit-arsenal

(Status: Normal)

8 new "cruiser-class" units (revenant variant)
2 new "capitals" (along with lich and reaper factories)
and 2 powerful "mothership" class destroyers are added into 
mindustry. All require the vanilla resources and have sprites which 
resemble the vanilla art style 

2 new heavy land units.
4 new turrets
8 new special enemies
1 Super boss unit

4 new campaign maps.

Soon to come: Crimson expansion. A new lineup of maps and ships at the other end of the Disconsolate Passage map
with new resources and others

(if you want to play around with the units in sandbox
I recommend increasing unit production
speed in custom settings or downloading infinitodustry and using the 
overjector because capital ship production time
is SLOW)
