# Extended-unit-arsenal

(Status: normal)

9 new "cruiser-class" units (revenant variant)
2 new "capitals" (along with lich and reaper factories)
and 2 powerful "mothership" class destroyers are added into 
mindustry. All require the vanilla resources and have sprites which 
resemble the vanilla art style 

Turrets: 7 vanilla-resource turrets and  5 using special ores
9 new "dark" enemy units
Plus 11 campaign maps and a boss battle map


Hopefully this mod doesn't die in v6 lmao. RIP molten chasm fortress facs

(if you want to play around with the units in sandbox
I recommend increasing unit production
speed in custom settings or downloading infinitodustry and using the 
overjector because capital ship production time
is SLOW)
